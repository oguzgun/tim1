# Alliance Behavior Standard (Basic)

## War day
- no order, no attack
- no “just one hit”
- don’t leak intent by hitting early

## Event days
- no “I finished mine” mentality; play the window together
- spend according to the call

## Communication
- notify before long inactivity
- conflicts go to leadership, not public chat
