# Hero Traps and Exceptions — Tier List Blindness

Reference: ../systems/heroes/01_Hero_Overview.md

---

## 1) Why tier lists aren’t enough
They don’t tell you:
- do you have shard access?
- are you aligned with windows?
- are you breaking role balance?

Common regret:
- “I invested because it was S-tier, then shards dried up.”

## 2) DPS addiction
New players chase damage.
Veterans repeat:
- no tank = DPS doesn’t function
- no utility = fight tempo collapses

## 3) Exceptions (server meta)
Some blocks reward early tank focus as a counter.
But only if:
- alliance plan exists
- enemy meta is known
- shard flow is sustainable

## 4) The “spend money to fix it” trap
Even community advice can be “just buy X”.
Veteran correction:
- spending without a window reduces ROI
- wrong window = wrong return
