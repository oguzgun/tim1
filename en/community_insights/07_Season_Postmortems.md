## 1) Three traits of winning alliances
1) enforce window discipline  
2) control war-day reflexes  
3) clarify coordination (who/when/what)

## 2) Three traits of losing alliances
1) everyone does their own thing  
2) early hits and information leaks  
3) spending in every event (pool drains)

## 3) Whales vs F2P balance
Community experience:

- F2P without discipline collapses
- best combo: whale spike + F2P window discipline

## 4) Server politics

- coalition timing
- target wars
- alliance-to-alliance coordination
