## Myth #1: “More activity = better progress”
The most common complaint is:
- I log in every day
- I don’t miss events
- but everyone still passes me

Veteran answer is consistent:
- the issue is not activity
- it’s **early spending**

Highly active early players often:
- burn speedups to avoid idle time
- fill days with small upgrades
- enter the first real window with nothing left

## Myth #2: “Leaderboard means I’m playing right”
Early leaderboards measure:
- who spent more
- who burned earlier

Good play isn’t staying on top daily;
it’s being able to spike when the window opens.

## Myth #3: “Upgrade just to stay busy” (Idle Anxiety)
No plan, no target—just discomfort with idle queues.
Veteran truth:
- idle time is annoying
- wrong upgrades hurt for months

## Myth #4: “HQ rush = fast growth” (partly true)
Unplanned HQ rush becomes “high HQ, everything blocked.”
Planned rush keeps requirements close and finishes inside windows.

## Myth #5: “Alliance is just buffs”
A strong alliance is a timing filter:
- teaches when NOT to spend
- enforces window discipline
- breaks bad war-day reflexes

## Final: the only early-game goal
Early game is not about looking strong:
- enter mid-game without damage
- build a speedup pool
- never leave research idle
