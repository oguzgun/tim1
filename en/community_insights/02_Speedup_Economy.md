## 1) If you treat speedups as “save time”, you lose
New players think: “finish now.”
Veterans think: “finish **inside the window** for completion points.”

### The Pre-start / Pre-load technique
- start long upgrades before the phase begins
- when the window opens, use small speedups to complete
- you get full completion credit

Community guides often describe this “start early → finish during window” logic.

## 2) Drip spending is the stealth tax
Small speedups look harmless.
They quietly drain the pool until the first real window arrives—and you’re empty.

## 3) Who wastes the most?
- “queues must never be idle” players
- leaderboard chasers
- reflex spenders who burn on every event

Veteran rule:
> “No window target = don’t touch speedups.”

## 4) Which speedups are more valuable?
Common experience:
- save building/research speedups for spikes
- training speedups are situational (pre-war / on call)

## 5) Alliance windows are ROI windows
Solo spending: points without momentum.
Coordinated spending: points + momentum + pressure.
