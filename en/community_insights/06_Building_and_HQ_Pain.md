# HQ/Building Pain — “High HQ, Everything Blocked” Syndrome

Reference: ../systems/buildings/01_Building_Overview.md

---

## 1) The classic complaint: high HQ but can’t play
Usually caused by:
- HQ rushed
- core buildings lagging
- key systems blocked

Fix is planning, not more random spending.

## 2) Why core blockers repeat
Common blockers:
- Tech/Research
- Barracks/training
- Wall
- Alliance Center

If they lag:
- upgrade chain breaks
- you either have nothing to finish in windows—or too much unfinished backlog

## 3) The builder queue debate
Community often calls the 2nd queue the real QoL spend.
But the trap:
- having more queues doesn’t justify spending outside windows

## 4) Practical HQ method
- set a target HQ
- list requirements
- start long jobs before windows
- finish inside the window
