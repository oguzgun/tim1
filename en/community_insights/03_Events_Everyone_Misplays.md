## 1) Why “I finished solo” is bad
Events are not only rewards—they’re **timing**:
- finishing together creates visible spikes
- enemies can’t react
- alliance gains momentum

Solo completion gives rewards but loses the window.

## 2) Early war hits: the most expensive 5 seconds
Common story:
- someone hits early
- enemy wakes up
- sets defense
- later the alliance asks “why did we lose?”

That’s why our rule is strict:
> No order, no attack.

## 3) Top 3 misplays
1) drip spending  
2) finishing in the wrong phase  
3) missing leadership calls

## 4) “But I earned points”
Veteran reply:
- yes, you got points
- but you shrank the spike
- and you gave the enemy free information
