# Counterintuitive Truths — “Hard to Believe, But It Works”

This file captures the most debated counterintuitive truths.

---

## 1) Sometimes “spending nothing” is the most aggressive play
Enemies drip-spend daily.
You stockpile for 5 days and spike on day 6.
The power gap becomes visible and creates pressure.

## 2) More builder queues ≠ faster growth
More queues often make players:
- less disciplined
- more likely to spend outside windows
Result: the pool drains.

## 3) High DPS doesn’t guarantee wins
Combat is not only damage:
- positioning
- tempo
- control
- role balance

## 4) Completing at the right time beats simply completing
Scoring comes from completion.
You plan finishes, not starts.
