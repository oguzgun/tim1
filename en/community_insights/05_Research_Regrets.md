# Research Regrets — “I Wish I Unlocked This First”

Reference: ../systems/research/01_Research_Overview.md

## 1) Most common regret: delaying Development/Economy
Pattern:
- combat research first
- economy efficiency falls behind
- then everything feels slow and expensive

Veterans call it a hidden tax:
- upgrades take longer
- research costs feel brutal

## 2) The “new tree” excitement
When Garage/team branches unlock, players rush them.
Community experience:
- costs ramp fast
- heavy early investment outside windows is wasted

## 3) The right research question
Not “what should I click?” but:
- “which window is this for?”
- “what does this buy me two weeks from now?”

## 4) Alliance impact
Research changes:
- war consistency
- event scoring capacity
- spike size
